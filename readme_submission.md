# BRAD Supplementary Material Overview

## Supplementary Material
The `BRAD_Supplementary_Material.pdf` contains additional information referenced
in our submission.

## System Code
The `brad_code.tar.gz` file contains the BRAD system artifacts (i.e., our
system's code).

You can extract the contents by running `tar xzf brad_code.tar.gz`. The code is
organized into Python modules; the files are inside the `brad/src/brad/`
directory.

You can install the system by running `pip install .` in the outer `brad`
directory. This will also install the system's Python dependencies.
