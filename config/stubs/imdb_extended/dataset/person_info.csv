2|4147861|19|"Richard Matthew Clark was born and raised in southeastern, NC, in a small town called, Chadbourn, NC.  He has a tragic tale filled with emotion that becomes one with the canvas he paints. Clark has a way through any media to lead you into a world that traps your soul.  His mother left him at six months old and his dad that's drinking almost destroyed the both of them.  His mother came back into his life when he was twelve only to attempt to murder him.  Art was his only outlet to express his emotion. His senior year in High School he excelled in the arts and was offered a full scholarship to the Parsons School of Art and the Art Institute, as well as, an internship with Marvel and Disney.  The light at the end of the tunnel was soon dimmed as he had to put his dad in a rehab clinic and drop out of school to save their home.  He saved their home but soon after his father was released from rehab his dad furious of being admitted into the treatment center, gave the home up any way and the two went their separate ways.  With no one to seek shelter with Clark found himself sleeping in a cemetery on a cement tomb staring at the sky seeking a way out.  He went to a local community college during the day where he obtained his adult high school diploma and joined the United States Army.  He found himself joining the military where he fought in the Infantry and forever tried to find a way back to the path to use his art. He is the type of person that has faced trial after trial but no matter how many times he has been knocked to the ground he has always managed to summon the strength to stand back up and face whatever the powers that be had to throw at him.  Trying to have a real family for once he married at 18 and had 2 sons by 21. His wife turned out to be just like his mom and ended up walking out on the family and never looking back.  He was a single father and left the military where he would sell sketches and paint murals for income.  3 years past and he built a sign and graphics company and then married a female that tried to take what he had worked so hard to build. They had one child together and during the divorce proceeding the wife told the judge ""Sir he can have the child I just want the money!"" Clark threw the keys to her from across the court room and kept his 3 sons together.  He lost everything again but then kept the thing that mattered most....his children.  With just an airbrush left he went to the beaches of the Carolina's and started painting t-shirts for money. This fine artist that seemed to channel the spirits of the masters had been reduced to doing whatever it took art wise to eat.  He found himself working night and day to provide for everyone and with the street smarts he possessed he managed to turn money over and open an airbrush shop in the mall. Three years past and he met a bi racial girl that was born and raised in Germany. They dated for a while and she seemed to be the only one that could tame the battle tossed artist.  They were married in 2005 and now Clark finally has his family and now with four sons.  Although, Clark, has been through so much he always remains positive and humble and true to his southern charm. His work is able to captivate people from all walks of life and crosses over to all races, religions and backgrounds. His art is now world wide and his clients include everyone from the Ruff Ryderz, Warren Sapp and the Hollywood Elite.  Mr. Clark does everything from acting, producing, writing screenplays, set painting, special effects make up, music; and even owns custom body shops and mall stores, as well as, his own Production Company.  Born and raised in the Carolina's of the United States he is a hardened and battle tossed soul that still displays the characteristics of a leader. One that does not drink or use drugs; he stands as a knight making sure others do not have to struggle and feel the pain that he has known."|"Tesha Dockery ""germanpheonix@yahoo.com"""

He remained there for seven years, becoming the most popular New York radio DJ. He was an early supporter of singer Bobby Darin, inspired and then 'broke' his hit single, 'Splish-Splash', and made a guest appearance on his ""This is Your Life"" TV tribute in late 1959.  In 1964, he was one of the first Americans to interview The Beatles, firstly by phone, later joining them in their hotel suite. From then on he acted as their ""Mr. Fix-it"", arranging for them to visit all the best clubs and restaurants. He also championed their records and for a while, he dubbed himself ""the fifth Beatle"" and became a trusted friend of the group during their American tours, though not of manager Brian Epstein, who apparently resented his considerable influence.  He left WINS in 1965 and later resurfaced as a presenter on WOR-FM - the first FM rock station.  Married six times, he died of cancer on 21 February 1982, in Los Angeles, California."|Anonymous

99|105|19|"'Til Tuesday were an excellent and intelligent 1980s New Wave rock quartet from Boston, Massachusetts. The group first got together in 1982. The band members were: Aimee Mann (vocals/bass), Robert Holmes (vocals/guitar), Joey Pesce (keyboards), and Michael Hausman (drums). Their music was distinguished by Mann's beautiful vocals, exceptionally literate lyrics, thoughtful and mature subject matter, and rich, lovely melodies. 'Til Tuesday started out playing around the Boston area and won Boston's WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble battle of the bands contest in 1983. They subsequently signed with the label Epic Records and released their debut album ""Voices Carry"" in 1985. The haunting and poignant titular tune was a substantial hit single; it peaked at #8 on the Billboard pop radio charts. The album also sold well; it reached #19 on the Top 20 album charts. Moreover, the music video for ""Voices Carry"" won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. Alas, the band's follow-up 1986 album ""Welcome Home"" was less successful; it barely cracked the Top 50 at #49 on the Billboard album charts. The moving song ""What About Love"" did a little better; it went all the way to #26 on the Billboard pop radio charts. Although their third and final album ""Everything's Different Now"" received positive notices from music critics in 1988, it nonetheless was a complete commercial flop. 'Til Tuesday broke up in 1988. Aimee Mann has since gone on to have a hugely successful solo career while Michael Hausman serves as Mann's manager."|woodyanders
